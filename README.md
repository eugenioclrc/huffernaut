Huffernaut is an educational project that aims to solve all Ethernaut challenges using the Huff programming language. This project is designed for developers who want to learn and improve their skills in Ethereum smart contract development, particularly with the low-level Huff language.


## Introduction

Ethernaut is a popular series of smart contract security challenges on the Ethereum blockchain. This project, Huffernaut, aims to provide solutions for these challenges using the Huff programming language. Huff is a low-level language that compiles directly to EVM bytecode, allowing developers to create highly optimized and efficient smart contracts.

## Getting Started


### Requirements

The following will need to be installed in order to use this template. Please follow the links and instructions.

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)  
    -   You'll know you've done it right if you can run `git --version`
-   [Foundry / Foundryup](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry)
    -   This will install `forge`, `cast`, and `anvil`
    -   You can test you've installed them right by running `forge --version` and get an output like: `forge 0.2.0 (92f8951 2022-08-06T00:09:32.96582Z)`
    -   To get the latest of each, just run `foundryup`
-   [Huff Compiler](https://docs.huff.sh/get-started/installing/)
    -   You'll know you've done it right if you can run `huffc --version` and get an output like: `huffc 0.3.0`

### Quickstart

1. Clone this repo or use template

Click "Use this template" on [GitHub](https://github.com/huff-language/huff-project-template) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

Or run:

```
git clone https://github.com/huff-language/huff-project-template
cd huff-project-template
```

2. Install dependencies

Once you've cloned and entered into your repository, you need to install the necessary dependencies. In order to do so, simply run:

```shell
forge install
```

3. Build & Test

To build and test your contracts, you can run:

```shell
forge build
forge test
```

For more information on how to use Foundry, check out the [Foundry Github Repository](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) and the [foundry-huff library repository](https://github.com/huff-language/foundry-huff).
